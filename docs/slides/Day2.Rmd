## Tidy data

------  

![](racoon.gif)

-----

### The essence of tidy data is:
  
1. Each variable forms a column
2. Each observation forms a row
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

-----

### Why?

- standarized
- easier for you and others to analyze
- easier for the computer to analyze

-----

Is this messy or tidy data?

```{r}
head(iris)
```

-----

Why is this tidy?
```{r}
gather(iris, petal_measurments, value, -Species) %>% head()
```


-----

#### Homework

Go find a dataset that you've used in the past or are currently using.  Try to determine if it is tidy or messy.  If it's messy how would you restructure it to be tidier?

-----
For a more detailed summary of the tidy data concept, see the `tidyr` vignette

```
browseVignettes("tidyr")
```





## Basic data manipulation

## Importing data

The `readr` package is your best bet for data import.  Use the apprpriate `read_*` function for your data.

Comma separated
```
read_csv()
```

Tab separated
```
read_tsv()
```

Space separated
```
read_table()
```


------

But you have to understand your data.

- Do you have headers?
- What is the separator?
- What type of data do you have?  Numeric? Integers? Dates? Ranges?
- readr usually does a good job of auto-detecting column formats but you still have to check!
- Are there lines you need to skip?

-----

- Try to avoid Excel files.  
- You can use `readxl` but more often then not I would recommend saving your worksheet in excel as csv or txt file and using `readr`.
- This also makes it easier to share your data and analysis.

-----

Some of you may have already seen something like `read.table(...)`.  

This will work fine but it's not nearly as good at detecting column types and you'll want to be sure to set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to avoid surprises.
 
Note that the readr package also has functions for writing.


## Cleaning and restructuring data

90% of data analysis is cleaning your data.  

-----

### Step 1:  Make sure it imported correctly  

- Are your column types correct?
- Are all the columns and rows there?
- How about your headers (if you have them)?
- Look at your data!

-----  

### Step 2:  Tidy it up

- Think about how you want your data structured for downstream analysis
- You may need a couple of versions, one for making some summary plots, maybe a few subsets, maybe a matrix of the numeric columns for something like PCA.
- What are your observations?  What are your variables?  Do you need multiple tables to capture your data better?
- Use `tidyr::gather()` and `tidyr::spread()` to appropriately transform your data
- If you have super messy data with lots of code needed to clean it up consider saving a cleaned up copy of your data and creating a separate script that documents everything you did.


## Doing useful stuff with your data

What you do next will depend on your own specific analyis.  Somethings you may do include:  

- making plots
- statistical summaries (mean, min, max, etc)
- statistical tests (Are the means different? Did my experiment work?!?!)
- add in to a larger data set such as sample data for an RNA-seq experiment


## Pipes: Ceci n'est pas un pipe

Using pipes for cleaner more useful code


-----

Pipes allow us to chain functions together instead of nesting them for cleaner, more intuiative code.

```{r} 
iris_tidy = gather(iris, petal_measurments, value, -Species)
summarise(group_by(iris_tidy, Species, petal_measurments), mean = mean(value))
```

-----

Instead:

```{r}
iris %>% 
	gather(petal_measurments, value, -Species) %>% 
	group_by(Species, petal_measurments) %>% 
	summarise(mean = mean(value))
```

-----

The `magrittr` package is where to find pipes and all sorts of useful things but if you only use the ` %>% ` function, then there is no need to attach `magrittr` as dplyr also imports this function.
