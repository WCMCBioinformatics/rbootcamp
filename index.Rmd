title: "R Bootcamp for Biolgists"
---

## Overview

Introduction to the R programming language with a focus on using it for biological data analysis.  The purpose of this course is to teach scientists (students, postdocs, PIs) in the biological and medical sciences to use R for typical data analysis tasks they might encounter routinely.  This includes sequence analysis and other bioinformatics tasks.  No prior knowledge of R is expected and workshop attendees can expect to come away with a skill set that is immediately translatable to their respective data tasks.

## Workshop Structure

This is a two week course that will consist of 6, 3 hour sessions consisting of both lecture and lab time.


## Learning Objectives

At the end of the workshop you will able to:

* Install and update R
* Use the Rstudio IDE
* Understand what CRAN and Bioconductor are and what the differences are between them
* Install and update R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor
* Import a wide variety of data types into R
* Understand the basic data types: integer, numeric, logical, character
* Understand R's basic data structures: vector, matrix, list, data.frame
* Understand basic programming concepts: functions, objects, loops, vectorization, conditionals
* Manipulate data structures by subsetting and indexing
* Understand key base R functions: seq, apply (and friends)
* Manipulate data with dplyr and friends
* Make plots with ggplot
* Find help about any function
* Understand some common R errors and how to deal with them
* Find and evaluate R packages needed for a particular analysis
* Understand the difference between `<-` and `=` and make your own choice about which one to use



## Preparation

Attendees are expected to come with their own laptops and have already installed R and RStudio as well as completed at least one of the following online tutorials.
